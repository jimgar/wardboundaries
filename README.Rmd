## Overview

**wardboundaries** is an R data package for mapping UK ward boundaries.

The only objects in the package are [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) tibbles of ward boundaries, obtained from the ONS Open Geography Portal. All the original variables and observations are retained and a `geometry` column of type MULTIPOLYGON has been added. LAD codes and names have been added to datasets where required, as I believe they will prove useful in most use cases.

This means the data is ready to be joined to measurements and plotted with e.g. `ggplot2` or `leaflet`.

Current datasets are:

- dec2022 (December 2022)
- dec2021 (December 2021)
- dec2020 (December 2020)
- dec2019 (December 2019)
- dec2011 (December 2011, unfortunately England and Wales only available)

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("jimgar/wardboundaries")
```

## Use and examples

### Access

Accessing a dataset can be done two ways.

By namespace, without loading the whole library

``` {r}
wardboundaries::dec2022
```

Or by loading the whole library

``` {r}
library(wardboundaries)

dec2022
```

### Map with ggplot2

Perhaps you have some sort of demographic data for each ward. Plotting this as a choropleth with ggplot2 is nice and straightforward

``` {r}
# Make some random numbers that represent a demographic dataset 
demo_data <- tibble::tibble(
  WD22CD = dplyr::pull(wardboundaries::dec2022, WD22CD),
  number_of_ducks = sample(
    150:1500, nrow(wardboundaries::dec2022), replace = TRUE
    )
)

demo_data
```

``` {r, warning = FALSE}
# Join the datasets together
ducks_per_ward <- dplyr::left_join(
  wardboundaries::dec2022,
  demo_data, 
  by = dplyr::join_by(WD22CD)
)
```

``` {r}
# Plot
ducks_per_ward |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(ggplot2::aes(fill = number_of_ducks), colour = NA) +
  ggplot2::theme_void()
```

The following plot isn't exactly pretty, but it shows how easy it is to focus 
in on a particular local authority and add labels 

``` {r, warning = FALSE}
# Plot
ducks_per_ward |>
  dplyr::filter(LAD22NM == "Vale of White Horse") |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(
    ggplot2::aes(fill = number_of_ducks), 
    colour = NA,
    show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf_label(ggplot2::aes(label = number_of_ducks)) +
  ggplot2::theme_void()
```

### Map with leaflet

The following example is mainly cribbed from [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/choropleths.html). With a couple of format
helpers and not much code, it's possible to create an interactive version of
the map

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Format helpers
pal <- leaflet::colorNumeric("Greens", domain = ducks_per_ward$number_of_ducks)
thousands <- scales::label_comma()

labels <- sprintf(
  "<strong>%s</strong><br/>%s",
  ducks_per_ward$WD22NM, thousands(ducks_per_ward$number_of_ducks)
) |> lapply(htmltools::HTML)

# Leaflet map
leaflet::leaflet() |>
  leaflet::addTiles() |>
  leaflet::addPolygons(
    data = ducks_per_ward,
    fillColor = ~pal(number_of_ducks),
    weight = 0.1,
    opacity = 0.9,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "3",
    fillOpacity = 0.9,
    highlightOptions = leaflet::highlightOptions(
      weight = 1,
      color = "yellow",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.9,
      bringToFront = TRUE),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = leaflet::labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")
  ) |>
  leaflet::addLegend(
    pal = pal,
    values = ducks_per_ward$number_of_ducks,
    opacity = 0.9,
    title = NULL,
    position = "topleft"
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "centre"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/images/leaflet.gif")
```

## Further resources

### geographr

If your needs are suited to my example maps above then **wardboundaries** works just fine. 

If you have more complex requirements then I recommend checking out [geographr](https://github.com/humaniverse/geographr). They go far beyond the simple local authority / ward scenario and have boundaries for larger hierarchies, lookup tables, NHS point data, etc. Each dataset in **geographr** is slimmed down to the essential variables, so you may have to stitch different datasets together. I only ever need LAD to Ward, and that's the main reason **wardboundaries** exists. 

### Trafford lab API post

A couple of weeks before making this package I knew next to nothing about geospatial data or how to get hold of it. I still don't, but Trafford Council's Data lab wrote a very helpful [Medium post](https://medium.com/@traffordDataLab/pushing-the-boundaries-with-the-open-geography-portal-api-4d70637bddc3) that explains how to work with the ONS Open Geography Portal's API to get data in practice. If you have a niche interest this resource will help you understand how to create a specific query for your needs and read the data straight into R with `sf`.

### R map books

- [Spatial Data Science (with applications in R)](https://r-spatial.org/book/) "introduces and explains the concepts underlying spatial data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how this affects analysis"
- [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html) "is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software"
